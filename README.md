# colorscrollor
Playing around with colored squares. Techy demo. You should checkout the demo, 
which you can do by cloning this repository and opening the `demo.html` file in 
your browser (you do not need a web server or anything, just open the file). If 
you are lazy, impatient or feel like I should be less demanding (rightfully so 
probably), you can also view it online [on 
RawGit](https://rawgit.com/Caster/colorscrollor/master/demo.html).

Feedback is welcome. Don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.
